“I am deeply touched by each sentence that I read in this book. For someone
with schizoaffective disorder who is being treated with psychotic medication,
it is never easy to summarize the whole process of his life into a wonderful,
epic book that truly blesses its readers. In brother Jeffrey’s encounter with
Christ, all the symptoms of the mental disorder that he experiences are
processed and continually being perfected. Brother Jeffery continues to
struggle and to be sustained in victory. He is transformed, instead of just
doing nothing about his condition. With the blessing of extraordinary
intelligence, an eagerness to recover and to be a blessing, the love from
those around him, and a thirst for science and the application of
psychotherapy techniques that he learned, brother Jeffrey is able to flap his
wings to become a beautiful butterfly that inspires many people. This book
will be an inspiration for the clients in the Rehabilitation Center that we
serve, for their families, for the caregivers who serve people with mental
disorder, for psychology and theology students, or for everyone who is
interested in mental health ministry. Congratulations, brother Jeffrey! Thank
you for fighting and sharing with us the weaknesses and the vulnerability that
you experience. Thank you for not dwelling in weakness, and for announcing
victory instead in every process of recovery. Through Jeffrey’s encounter with
Christ, every scar from his wounded heart has been transformed and expressed
as an inspiring written work.”

“God’s Light in the Midst of Darkness. Another amazingly inspiring work of
Jeffrey Lim who experienced bipolar mood disorder. In his suffering, Jeffrey
has struggled toward recovery and has gained a deeper knowledge of the Lord,
whose existence and power he trusts. Jeffrey has also been quite open in
accepting the reality of his condition so that he was able to change his
paradigm. He also attempts to learn more about the disorder he suffers from
various books and media in order to overcome his difficulties through each
grace that the Lord provides. This book truly strengthens our faith through
its message: everything that happens in this life will bring about good for
those who love Him (Romans 8:28).”
