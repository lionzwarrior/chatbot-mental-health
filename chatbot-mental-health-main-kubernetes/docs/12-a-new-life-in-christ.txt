##  12\. A New Life in Christ

"That is, in reference to your former way of life, you are to discard the old
self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be renewed in the
spirit of your mind, and to put on the new self, which has been created in
God's likeness—in true righteousness and holiness." (Ephesians 4:22-24)

When someone accepts the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, a
miraculous change occurs within them. A believer, even one suffering from
depression, receives a new life in Christ. The Bible teaches that if anyone is
in Christ, they are a new creation; the old has gone, the new is here (2
Corinthians 5:17).  
What is this new life in Christ?

a. There is a rebirth (born again).  
In the book of John 3, there is a story of a Pharisee named Nicodemus who came
to Jesus at night to talk with Him. He came by night for fear of the other
Pharisees who hated Jesus. Jesus was despised by the Pharisees because His
life and teachings were considered against the Jewish religion. However,
Nicodemus saw something in Jesus, and he believed that Jesus was from God. So,
when Jesus met him, he said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has
come from God; for no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were
not with him." Jesus replied straightforwardly, "Truly, I tell you, unless
someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus was
puzzled by Jesus' answer and asked, "How can someone be born when they are
old? Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be
born!" Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and
the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God." (John 3)

When someone repents and receives Jesus Christ, they are truly born again,
what we call being born again. Why are they born again? Because the Holy
Spirit has revived their dead spirit and enlightened their spiritual eyes.
Then, the Holy Spirit makes them aware of their sin against God, causing them
to regret their sin and softening their heart to come to Christ. The Holy
Spirit leads them to repent of their sin and turn to God. Their life is
restored to its original purpose, which is to glorify God's name.

At the time of being born again, the Lord has actually entered their heart.
The Holy Spirit already dwells within that person. In them, there is a new
spirit and a new heart. This is in accordance with God’s promise:

"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove
from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my
Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my
laws." (Ezekiel 36:26-27).

"But this is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that
time," declares the Lord. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on
their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people." (Jeremiah
31:33).

When someone is born again, they have a new life from the Lord. Their dead
spirituality is revived. What does it mean to live spiritually in Christ? When
born again, the believer's spirit is spiritually united with the Lord because
the Lord lives in the believer’s heart. It is the Holy Spirit dwelling in the
believer’s heart that revives their spirituality. But, unlike Adam, the
spiritual union with God is perfect and eternal in Christ, the last Adam.
Eternal life is given, and it is not just life after death, but life given
when one believes in Christ. It is life everlasting. After the believer dies,
although their body will leave them and will eventually be replaced with a
glorious body, the life in Christ, which began when someone believed in
Christ, continues forever.  
This new life in Christ then becomes the power for the believer to live
according to God's purpose, which is to glorify His name. Without being born
again, one cannot fulfill God's law. However, with the new birth, humans can
live according to God's word. There is a new nature and power that accompanies
the believer as we live in Christ.

1\. Jesus, my Lord will love me forever,  
From Him no pow'r of evil can sever,  
He gave His life to ransom my soul;  
Now I belong to Him;



Now I belong to Jesus,  
Jesus belongs to me,  
Not for the years of time alone,  
But for eternity.



2\. Once I was lost in sin's degradation,  
Jesus came down to bring me salvation,  
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,  
Now I belong to Him;



Now I belong to Jesus,  
Jesus belongs to me,  
Not for the years of time alone,  
But for eternity.



3\. Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me,  
Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me  
His precious blood, He came to redeem,  
Now I belong to Him;



Now I belong to Jesus,  
Jesus belongs to me,  
Not for the years of time alone,  
But for eternity.



( _Now I Belong To Jesus_ , Norman J. Clayton)



b. New Nature and Status in Christ.

Those who believe in Christ acquire a new nature and status. Previously, the
nature and status of humans before God was as sinners. However, anyone who has
received Christ is given a new nature and status as a saint. This saintly
nature and status are granted to Christians, both those who are still
spiritual infants and mature Christians. When Apostle Paul wrote to the
Corinthians -- who were still living in sin and fleshliness -- he called them
saints. What is the difference between nature and status? The holy nature is
the believer's new fundamental trait, which is holiness. Meanwhile, status is
the believer's identity in the eyes of God, which is as saints.

How is this holy nature and status obtained by believers? Is it by effort? No!
This holy nature and status are not obtained from human efforts, but because
of God's calling. It is stated in the Bible that God's assembly is "called to
be saints" (1 Corinthians 1:2). This holy nature and status are obtained as a
result of the work of the Holy Spirit who transforms and sanctifies believers.

Many Christians think they are sinners saved by grace. Is this view correct?
Does it paint the true identity of the believer? Actually, it would be more
accurate to say that believers are saints who can still sin. Why? Because
believers no longer have the status of sinners but of saints. God Himself
calls His people saints. The Bible says so:

"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own
people, so that you may proclaim the mighty acts of Him who called you out of
darkness into His marvelous light." (1 Peter 2:9).

If someone still thinks that their nature is sinful, then they will live
according to that view, that they are sinners. Therefore, let us see believers
as they are, saints who can still sin.

The holy nature within believers becomes a strength to grow spiritually. The
Bible teaches that the body of believers is the temple of God (1 Corinthians
3:16) where God dwells. The Bible also teaches that the Holy Spirit resides
within the believer's spirit (Ezekiel 36). Believers have been sanctified in
Christ by the work of the Holy Spirit. In accordance with their holy nature,
saints hate sin. Hating sin is one of the characteristics of someone who has
been born again. And, in line with their holy nature, believers will not
continue to sin. If they sin, the Holy Spirit will reprove, and their
conscience will grieve. If someone continues to sin and enjoys sin, then their
new birth is questionable. Saints hate sin! Calvin said that the saints are
highly sensitive to small sins. In line with their holy nature, believers must
live holy lives.  
"but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your
behavior; because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" (1 Peter
1:15-16)

c. Abundance in Christ.

The Bible teaches that Jesus came so that people might have life, even life
more abundantly. In this sinful world, people seek abundant life. They look
for it in love, acceptance, self-security, and self-meaning. However, the
search for identity and self-meaning in the flesh will not satisfy the deepest
soul of man. True satisfaction of the human soul is only found in Christ.
Humans need the abundant life from God.

One day, as Jesus was passing through Samaria, He arrived at a town where
Jacob's well was located. Jesus, tired from the long journey, sat down by the
well around noon. A Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well. This
woman had already had five husbands and felt empty and meaningless. She sought
to fill her void with love, acceptance, self-security, and meaning in life,
all of which she looked for in men, hoping they would love and accept her,
provide security, and give her life meaning. However, her soul was never
satisfied, and she continued to change partners, deeply thirsting for the most
profound love.

Jesus knew the needs of the Samaritan woman. She needed God because only He
could satisfy her soul. Thus, Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink." The woman
was surprised because Jews did not associate with Samaritans, whom they
considered heretics. She said, "How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan, for a
drink?" Jesus replied, "If you knew about God's gift and who it is that says
to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given
you living water." Jesus offered her the living water that could satisfy the
human soul, the word of God. The woman, puzzled by His words, asked where she
could get this living water. Jesus answered, "Whoever drinks this water will
be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
Instead, the water I give them will become a spring within them, welling up to
eternal life." The Samaritan woman then asked Jesus for this living water so
she wouldn't have to keep coming to draw water.

Jesus, perceiving her innermost heart, knew that the deepest human need is
spiritual, obtainable only through God's word. He revealed Himself as the
Messiah to her, and she came to believe in Him. Her spiritual need for the
living water was ultimately satisfied and fulfilled in Christ. The Bible says,
"Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth
of God" (Matthew 4:4). Only God's word can fulfill the human soul, and this
abundance is found in Christ.

There is another story often heard in Sunday School about a tax collector
named Zacchaeus. The story begins as Jesus entered Jericho and passed through
the town. Zacchaeus, a wealthy chief tax collector, wanted to see who Jesus
was. Being short, he climbed a sycamore tree to see Him. Zacchaeus's heart was
thirsty as he looked upon Jesus, unsatisfied by his wealth, which had
previously filled his life. He might have thought that being rich would
satisfy his heart, secure his soul, and give his life meaning. However,
Zacchaeus felt his life was empty and meaningless until Jesus called to him.
Looking up at the sycamore tree, Jesus said, "Zacchaeus, come down
immediately; I must stay at your house today" (Luke 19:5).

Jesus knew Zacchaeus and called him by name. From that day on, Zacchaeus came
to know the Lord and repented. His deepest being was filled by Christ. He
repented, giving half of his wealth to the poor, and his life changed. He had
a new life.

Jesus Christ said that He came so that those who believe in Him may have life
and have it to the full (John 10:10). Eternal and abundant life is only found
in Jesus.

d. New Identity in Christ.

Sinful humans seek their identity in their lives in this world. Sinful humans,
dead due to transgressions, have no other choice but to find their identity,
purpose, and meaning of life in the world and in the flesh, like physical
inheritance and social status. The tendency of humans is to determine their
identity based on the things they do. Many people consider themselves
meaningful because of their profession, status, wealth, achievements, or
popularity. But what happens when they lose all that? Do they lose their self-
identity? There is an important principle, that is, "What we do does not
determine who we really are. It is who we are (our identity) that determines
what we do." So, the question is: Who is the believer's identity according to
the word of God?

Self-awareness is very important. John Calvin said that this self-awareness is
related to the knowledge of God. And, knowledge of God is related to self-
awareness. When one knows God, they know themselves. Conversely, when one
knows themselves, they know God. These two knowledges are interrelated. And,
one important thing is that no one can consistently behave inconsistently with
what they understand about themselves. In other words, a person's self-
knowledge will determine how they think, act, and behave. A person's identity
determines how they will live.

In relation to self-identity, believers in Lord Jesus are given a new
identity. The Bible says that:  
"But as many as received Him (Christ), to them He gave the right to become
children of God, to those who believe in His name." (John 1:12).

"Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should
be called children of God" (1 John 3:1).

Believers are given a new identity, as children of God!

The new identity in Christ is an important aspect of spiritual growth. In
relation to depression sufferers, the new identity is a strength to move
forward and grow. Wrong self-awareness and identity can lead to wrong views
and ways of life. Another important thing to be instilled is that "believers
are not determined by their circumstances or their past, but by the work of
Christ in their lives." We are not the product of our past. We are the product
of the work of Christ on the cross.

When someone believes in Christ, their life is the work of Christ, and they
have a new life and identity given by Christ. With their new identity in
Christ, their inner emptiness will be fulfilled. The soul of a human who
believes in Christ and in Christ will receive abundance in love, acceptance,
security, meaning, and purpose of life. All this is needed for those who
experience the dark night of the soul/depression.

The following will be attached about the identity of believers in Christ that
fills the human soul. This list is taken from the book Living Free in Christ
by Neil T. Anderson.
