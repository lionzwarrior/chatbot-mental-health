##  19\. William Cowper : A Sufferer of Depression Used by God

a. William Cowper's Life Struggles

We might know John Newton, the composer of the famous Christian hymn "Amazing
Grace." However, few are aware that Newton had a close friend named William
Cowper. Cowper was a poet who struggled with depression and despair throughout
his life. He suffered severe mental breakdowns four times. At 21, he plunged
into a severe depression, experiencing his first mental breakdown. Cowper
began to wrestle with the despair that became the theme of his life. At 28, he
had a total mental breakdown, attempting suicide three times. Subsequently, he
was admitted to an asylum, what we would now call a rehabilitation home.

At 32, Cowper lost complete contact with reality, suffering from delusions. In
December that year, he entered the St. Albans Insane Asylum, where Dr.
Nathaniel Cotton worked. Dr. Cotton was a believer who loved God and Cowper,
repeatedly offering hope to him.  
Six months later, Cowper found a Bible. Reading it, he discovered passages
about God's kindness, grace, and mercy through Jesus to the unfortunate.
Gradually, Cowper felt not utterly wretched because he found hope in the
Scriptures. He read Romans 3:25, regaining hope in his life. He testified to
finding faith and a shining light of truth within, feeling the sufficiency of
Christ's redemption. Cowper felt his sins forgiven and the perfection of
justification through Christ. He began to appreciate Dr. Cotton's place,
staying there 12 months after his conversion.

One might think Cowper's life story ends with emotional victories, but it was
far from it.

John Newton saw Cowper's tendency toward melancholy and seclusion, which led
Newton to visit as often as possible. They frequently walked and talked about
God and His purpose for the church. In 1769, Newton proposed collaborating
with Cowper on a book of hymns for the church. Newton thought it would be
excellent if Cowper's poetic talent could be used for hymn writing.
Eventually, Newton wrote 208 hymns, and Cowper wrote 68, including famous ones
like "God Moves in a Mysterious Way," "There is a Fountain Filled with Blood,"
and "O for a Closer Walk with God."

Cowper continued to suffer mental breakdowns, a life full of depression and
emotional struggles. He attempted suicide several times, but God prevented it.
Despite his emotional turmoil, Cowper produced many beautiful poems and hymns.
His productivity was halted for 10 years after a mental breakdown at 52. At
55, he suffered deep depression again. At 68, he wrote his last poem, "The
Cast Away," and died in despair at 69.

b. Reflection on Life in William Cowper's Hymns

Cowper's life was filled with depression and struggles due to mental and
emotional disorders. His life seemed hopeless and despairing. However, in his
mental suffering, there was God's grace accompanying him. God used Dr. Cotton
to guide Cowper. God also used John Newton to be a blessing to Cowper. Newton
directed Cowper's talents to serve God by writing hymns. Though Cowper's life
was fraught with mental struggles, it was not in vain. His life had meaning
and significance in eternity. Cowper's life struggles became a blessing
because from them came the creation of beautiful hymns. As seen in Cowper's
hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way," God works in mysterious ways in this
world. I believe that's what happened in the life of William Cowper.

God Moves in The Mysterious Way

God moves in a mysterious way  
His wonders to perform;  
He plants his footsteps in the sea,  
And rides upon the storm.

Deep in unfathomable mines  
Of never failing skill,  
He treasures up his bright designs  
And works his sovereign will.

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,  
The clouds ye so much dread  
Are big with mercy, and shall break  
In blessings on your head.

Judge not the lord by feeble sense,  
But trust him for his grace;  
behind a frowning providence  
He hides a smiling face.

His purpose will ripen fast,  
Unfolding every hour;  
the bud may have bitter taste,  
But sweet will be the flower.

Blind unbelief is sure to err,  
And scan his work in vain:  
God is his own interpreter,  
And He will make it plain.
