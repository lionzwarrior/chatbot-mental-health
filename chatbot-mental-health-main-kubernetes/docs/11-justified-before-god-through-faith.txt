##  11\. Justified Before God Through Faith

'You know that no one is justified by the law of the Torah, but only through
faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, we also have believed in Jesus Christ, so
that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law.
Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.' (Galatians 2:16)

The fundamental problem of humanity is sin. In a sinful state, humans are
guilty before God who is Holy, and, in God's justice, those who are guilty
deserve punishment.  
The effect of sin also causes humans to become conflicted and estranged from
God, from others, and from themselves. The effect of sin causes fear and guilt
within the soul. How can the effect of sin on the human soul be resolved? How
can humans be at peace before God and others?

One cause of spiritual depression or the dark night of the soul is the sense
of guilt within a person. Many people experience guilt in their lives, leading
them to a cycle of depression. They continue to be punished and accused
because of their sins.

However, the Bible declares that there is no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). When sinful humans believe, have faith, and accept
the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, they will receive God's forgiveness.
As a Judge, God no longer punishes humans because the punishment for sin has
been placed upon Christ. Moreover, whoever believes in the Lord Jesus Christ
will be justified before God. Justification here means that before God, humans
are no longer legally guilty. Humans are legally right before God. They are no
longer punished for their sins. How is this possible? How can sinful humans be
justified before God?

Sinful humans cannot be justified before God by their good deeds. Humans may
try to do various charitable activities, social actions, worship, religion,
and ethics. However, all these efforts will not make them right before God.
Because all human goodness before God is like filthy and disgusting rags
(Isaiah 64:6). Human good deeds cannot and will not make them right before
God. Because the Holy God demands total perfection from sin, which humans will
not be able to fulfill. Violating one law of God means violating all of God's
laws. The Bible says: 'For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble
in one point, he is guilty of all.' (James 2:10)

Who is the perfect human, who can fully obey God's law? There is none. That's
why, humans cannot be justified by their own good deeds. Humans cannot save
themselves before God.  
However, thanks be to Jesus Christ who replaced humans to live perfectly
before God. Jesus Christ fulfilled all of God's laws perfectly. He was sinless
and faultless in everything. And, whoever believes in Him, will be justified
before God. But on what basis are sinful humans justified before God? Not on
the basis of their good deeds, but because of the work and labor of the Lord
Jesus Christ on the cross. Sinful humans are justified not by their own
righteousness, but by the righteousness of Jesus Christ given to them. Here
there is an exchange, where the sins of humans are placed upon the sinless
Lord Jesus Christ, but the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ is given to
sinful humans.

How to obtain this justification? Only through faith. Only through belief.
Only when sinful humans realize that they are sinners and opposed to God then
repent and believe with their hearts in the Lord Jesus Christ as their
personal Lord and Savior. By faith, humans are justified before God. Faith is
the means by which humans are justified before God.  
What kind of faith saves? Not a blind faith. Not even faith that becomes mere
knowledge. But faith that relies on the Lord, which relies on the work of the
Lord Jesus on the cross.

Then, what is the impact of this justification for humans, especially for
those suffering from depression? The effect of justification before God is
that humans who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ no longer need to try to
justify themselves. Those who believe in Jesus Christ do not need to try to
cover up their own mistakes and sins. He does not need to try in any way to
cover up his guilty heart before God. Various ways of covering up the sinful
self are like wearing dirty clothes. Believers have Christ to cover their
sins. The righteousness of Christ covers the heart of the believer as clean
clothes are worn to cover the body. This is the perfection of Christ's
righteousness because he obeys the entire Law of Moses given to believers.

Thus, humans who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ can have peace in their
hearts. Why? Because they have been justified before God and have made peace
with God. God does not punish them anymore. The Lord Jesus Christ also gives
peace in that person's heart.

Peace. This is what humans need! This is what depression sufferers need!
Peace! This is what this world needs! Sinful humans cannot feel peace in their
hearts in other ways, before making peace with God their Creator. With
justification before God, those who believe in Christ Jesus do not need to
feel guilty and afraid in their hearts. Why? Because the Lord has forgiven
their sins, and therefore they no longer need to feel guilty and afraid. He
has been accepted as a child of the loving God. He is safe and loved in the
Lord.  
But what if the heart of the person who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ
still feels guilty and afraid? What if his conscience still accuses him and
makes him feel guilty? For this, he needs to know and believe in the Lord more
deeply. Regarding this, God declares:

"This is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at
rest in his presence: If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater
than our hearts, and he knows everything. Dear friends, if our hearts do not
condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we
ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. (1 John 3:19-22)

Conscience has no right to accuse when the Lord has justified. What right does
the conscience have to accuse when the Lord has justified? Apart from a
conscience that accuses, there is also the devil that accuses believers of
sins they have committed. The Bible teaches that the devil accuses humans day
and night.  
"I heard a loud voice in heaven say: 'Now have come the salvation and the
power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the
accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and
night, has been hurled down.'" (Revelation 12:10)

However, who is the devil to have the right to accuse human hearts when the
Lord has justified? If God is for us, then we can expel the evil one.  
"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from
you!" (James 4:7)

Those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are convinced that they are
justified before God. They are convinced that the Lord no longer punishes them
forever. Therefore, believers may have firm confidence to come before God with
a conscience purified from sin.  
"Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are
covered." (Psalm 32:1)

Being justified before God has a positive impact on believers, especially
those suffering from the dark night of the soul/depression. This justification
allows those suffering from depression to have peace in their souls. Even if
everything seems chaotic, one thing is certain: their soul has been reconciled
before God. He has been saved. Before God, he is already considered righteous.
And, it is not because of his own righteousness, but because of the
righteousness of Christ given to him. Depression sufferers who believe in
Christ need not feel fear, worry, or guilty because they are sinful and weak.
God has declared that they are righteous before Him because of Christ. They no
longer need to seek their own justification through good deeds and behavior.
And, because they are justified before God, the believer's soul is safe. This
security of the soul is something very important for humans. The human need
for soul security has been fulfilled in Christ by the grace of God. The soul
of the believer has been forgiven, justified, and accepted before God.  
The Psalmist says, "Truly my soul finds rest in God alone" (Psalm 62:1). This
is well depicted in the song titled "Safe in The Arms of Jesus".

Safe in the arms of Jesus,  
Safe on His gentle breast,  
There by His love o’ershaded,  
Sweetly my soul shall rest.  
Hark! ’tis the voice of angels,  
Borne in a song to me,  
Over the fields of glory,  
Over the jasper sea.

Refrain:  
Safe in the arms of Jesus,  
Safe on His gentle breast,  
There by His love o’ershaded,  
Sweetly my soul shall rest.

2\. Safe in the arms of Jesus,  
Safe from corroding care,  
Safe from the world’s temptations,  
Sin cannot harm me there.  
Free from the blight of sorrow,  
Free from my doubts and fears;  
Only a few more trials,  
Only a few more tears. [Refrain]

3\. Jesus, my heart’s dear refuge,  
Jesus has died for me;  
Firm on the Rock of Ages,  
Ever my trust shall be.  
Here let me wait with patience,  
Wait till the night is o’er;  
Wait till I see the morning  
Break on the golden shore. [Refrain]

(African Methodist Episcopal Church Hymnal, Syair: Safe in The Arms of Jesus,
Fanny Crosby.  Lagu: Howard Doane)
