##  22\. Testimony III: Tested for Hope and Patience (2003)

I want to give thanks to God who has allowed me to have the experience I wish
to share on this occasion. This experience has tested me to continue hoping
and being patient in the face of life. I hope that friends who read this and
are struggling will gain strength from this testimony.

After a year at the Reformed Institute, I took an academic leave. I asked
permission from Rev. Stephen Tong to study in Sydney, which he allowed as long
as I took good care of my life.  
In 1999, I went to Australia to study. At that time, I often suffered from
nausea due to depression, especially during the winter. Then, what troubled me
was not just depression, but also sinusitis problems. I only learned about
this in 2003, after finding out that I had previously undergone surgery to
remove nasal polyps. This was causing me frequent breathing difficulties due
to a blocked nose. While in Australia, my poor mental condition often made me
dizzy and unwell. Meanwhile, sinusitis also made it difficult for me to
breathe. Imagine how you would feel if you had to deal with emotional
problems, headaches, and breathlessness all at once. And I experienced this
for years.

Actually, I did seek medical treatment. I had been treated for sinusitis, and
the doctor had given me allergy spray. After using the spray, I could breathe
more easily, although I still felt tightness -- perhaps due to an unmet oxygen
need. That's why I often breathed through my mouth, which is very
uncomfortable during the winter with the very cold air. The headaches I then
felt also made things worse. However, since not everyone has the same
experiences and conditions, it's hard for me to describe what I had to go
through.

The struggle in Australia to complete my undergraduate degree was also not
easy. Often, I couldn't stand it and wanted to return to Indonesia because of
worsening mental health. But my mother always gave me strength and let me
fight. She really is a good mother who loves me. One of the hardest
experiences in completing my studies occurred in the final year when I had to
do a group assignment. At that time, my mental condition made it difficult for
me to concentrate. I appeared incompetent in group tasks, where each group
member could evaluate me, which I also did to other group members. Thank God,
at that time my friends understood my condition after I explained the
struggles I had. They did not give me a bad grade. Previously, my professor
had said that I would only get a 2 out of 10. He said that because I was
deemed incompetent in answering questions due to my inability to concentrate.
At that time, of course, I was very afraid of the possibility of not passing.
Thankfully, I was able to graduate, which happened solely by the grace of God.
At the end of 2002, I returned to Indonesia.

Once back in Indonesia, I could vomit up to 9-10 times a day due to dizziness
and nausea. This was in addition to sinus problems, which made it difficult
for me to breathe. This experience was far more unpleasant than before.
However, thank God, there was no winter that seriously disturbed my breathing.

Physical and mental struggles continued to occur in turn. After my return from
SAAT, I went through a dark period again. My physical condition was constantly
disturbed with dizziness, nausea, and inability to breathe, not to mention the
conditions of depression and empty emotions I also experienced. Finally, I
started taking psychiatric medications again and sought to find out the cause
of my physical illness. I then underwent MRI Scanning. From there, a positive
clue was found that I suffered from sinusitis, where there was a lot of pus
settled in my cheek area. I had to undergo surgery. The experience of the
surgery itself was not comfortable because with only local anesthesia, I could
feel the pain of the jaw being drilled from the inside. After the surgery, I
still had to endure pain and dizziness for a while, so I had to take
painkillers. That certainly was not a pleasant experience.

A few months after the surgery, the sinusitis reappeared. My cheek was again
filled with pus. Oh no! A second surgery had to be done. Oh, I felt so weak.
However, the core cause of the sinusitis had still not been found. I then also
had to go to an allergy clinic because it was said to be due to allergies. I
then underwent outpatient treatment for several months, but without progress.

However, God made a way. I then met a kind ENT (Ear, Nose, and  Throat)
doctor. He diagnosed that my nose was crooked and needed surgery. Finally, my
nose was operated on, the bones were straightened, and the polyps were removed
by laser. Praise the Lord, the suffering of difficulty breathing due to
sinusitis since 1999 was finally resolved. In 2003, I was finally able to
breathe again after treatment from that ENT doctor.

Nevertheless, I still struggle with the depression I experience. Ideally, I
would like to immediately reduce medication and become healthy. However, I am
taught to be patient. There needs to be a change in spiritual cultivation by
reading the word to produce long-term thought changes that I need to
experience. Faith is needed to fight depression. Everything has its time.

Is life suffering? Yes! However, we must still hope and be patient. Nothing
happens instantly. Everything has its time and season. Our God works at the
right time. Therefore, my brothers and sisters in Christ, let us entrust our
lives to the care of the Lord, by continuing to hope and be patient in
suffering. Be grateful if we are allowed to struggle, because that is what
makes us depend on the Lord and what makes us withstand the test. The key is
just to keep hoping and being patient.  
That is my story. I hope it can be a blessing to your faith.

Reflection: Hoping and Patient in Suffering

God has appointed everything  
Everything has its time  
But, often I ask,  
When is the time?

Our lives are full of self-struggle  
Who can understand it?  
Our own lives are full of mystery  
Who can uncover it?

Yet, let us learn  
To surrender to the Lord  
Hope and be patient  
In enduring suffering.

One thing we need to know  
Is that everything is beautiful in its time  
Our faithful God  
Leads the way of life until the end.

Everything brings goodness  
For those who love the Lord  
In everything there is kindness  
And the grace of God  
Let us learn  
To surrender ourselves  
Hope and be patient  
To the Lord.
