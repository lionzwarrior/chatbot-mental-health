##  My Struggle with the Darkness of the Soul

Oh, how my inner self suffers, oh Lord!  
My mind keeps spinning and can't be still  
I feel restless  
My heart feels worried  
It feels suffocating and my soul is pressed  
Oh, how my thoughts are uncontrollable  
And it's hard to concentrate  
I call out to my Lord  
Is there hope for my soul's distress?  
Is there a way out for this oppressed soul?  
Physical and mental suffering befalls me.  
When will all this end?  
Is there hope?

In the distress of my soul,  
In You, Lord, I trust  
You are my Creator and my Redeemer  
I believe these seemingly uncontrollable thoughts  
Are not beyond Your Almighty hand  
In the turmoil of fluctuating thoughts  
I believe, You are there  
In the anxiety of my heart  
There is Your comfort  
In the shaking of my soul  
There You are, upholding me.

So, I will say to myself:  
Be still my soul!  
Be still my soul!  
All will be well!  
All will be well!  
For, the Lord is always with me  
So, I speak within myself  
The day may turn dark  
Storms may come  
The weather may turn foul  
But, my Lord is unchanging  
His steadfast love remains forever  
His grace is abundant  
His light illuminates me  
His hand guides me  
His rod and His staff comfort me.

Oh, my Lord, my God  
I believe in You  
When I am afraid, I will trust in You!  
Let the mountains move  
And the hills shake  
Your steadfast love does not change  
My Lord, Lord Jesus Christ  
You are my Savior  
Who has redeemed my sins  
Who has forgiven my wrongdoings  
Who has brought me out from sin and death  
Who has saved my soul  
Revived my dead soul  
Providing hope  
Giving eternal life  
That is life everlasting  
A life full of abundance  
A life full of meaning.

I believe that You have a plan  
That through my suffering,  
Everything will be beautiful in its time  
My suffering is not in vain  
For, You work within me  
Strengthening my faith  
Giving me hope  
To always rely on You.

Thank you, Lord  
For all Your goodness  
May this reflection be pleasing in Your heart.

Amen.
