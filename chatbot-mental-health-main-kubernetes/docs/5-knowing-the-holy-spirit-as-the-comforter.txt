##  5\. Knowing the Holy Spirit as the Comforter

"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you." (John 14:26)

Before being crucified at Golgotha, Lord Jesus promised a Helper to His
disciples.

"I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Helper, that he may
abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for
he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I
will come to you."  
(John 14:16-18)

Lord Jesus promised the Comforter who would accompany His disciples. He will
live in our hearts and be with us forever.  
Who is this Comforter? Who is this Spirit of Truth?

He is the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Trinity. Lord Jesus asks for
the Holy Spirit from the Father, and the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father in
the name of Lord Jesus. The Holy Spirit will teach everything and remind us of
the words of Christ's teaching (John 14:26).

The Holy Spirit is a great Teacher and Counselor for those suffering from
depression in facing their life struggles. He is real and present in our
lives. As believers, we have the Holy Spirit as a helper to face various life
struggles.

(1). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Revelation. It is the Holy Spirit who
reveals the word of God to people.  
"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." (2 Peter 1:20-21)

The Holy Spirit is the Spirit who gives the word of God. The Holy Spirit is
also the Spirit of revelation that opens the spiritual eyes so that those
suffering from depression can know and understand the word. More than that, it
is the Holy Spirit who illuminates the truth in the hearts of believers and
lights up the darkened mind with the light of the word. Often, the thoughts of
those suffering from depression are in many dark clouds. This requires
illumination from the Holy Spirit so that they understand the truth of God's
word.

(2). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth. He is the Spirit who teaches the
truth and brings believers into the fullness of the word's truth.  
"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
truth." (John 16:13)

The Holy Spirit will lead us to know God, ourselves, and the world correctly.
The Holy Spirit will lead those suffering from depression to know the truth.
Praise be to God that the guarantee for believers is God Himself, who will
bring people into all truth.

(3). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Comfort. The Bible teaches that the Holy
Spirit accompanies believers and dwells within them.  
"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
you, which ye have of God ..." (1 Corinthians 6:19)

Not only that, but the Holy Spirit also comforts believers and strengthens
them with all the riches of God's word. Those suffering from depression will
receive comfort from the Comforter who accompanies them.

(4). The Holy Spirit helps those suffering from depression in weakness.  
"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we
should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts
knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the
saints according to the will of God." (Romans 8:26-27)

The Holy Spirit helps those suffering from depression to pray, where He leads
them to pray according to the will of God. The Holy Spirit understands the
life struggles of those suffering from depression and intercedes for believers
to God the Father. It is truly wonderful to realize that Lord Jesus, our Great
High Priest, along with the Holy Spirit, intercedes for believers to God the
Father in heaven.

(5) The Holy Spirit sanctifies those suffering from depression.  
The Holy Spirit is the Spirit who is Holy. And when He dwells within
believers, He sanctifies the life of the believer to glorify God.  
"But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the
Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying
work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth." (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

With the presence of the Holy Spirit within believers, those suffering from
depression can believe that God is with them. Those suffering can be thankful
that God is with us and dwells among us who are small and weak. This is
extraordinary and very comforting! God is with us in our struggles!  
"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so
that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Romans
15:13)

Therefore, those suffering from depression may realize the presence of God's
Spirit dwelling within them! The Holy Spirit within the believer has the power
so that those suffering from depression can obey the word and live according
to the will of God.

"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from
you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my
Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my
laws." (Ezekiel 36:26-27)

Those suffering from depression need not live in fear because "For God has not
given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." (2
Timothy 1:7).  
The word "sound mind" in 2 Timothy 1:7 is translated into English as "sound
mind". This word comes from the same Greek root as the word used in the story
when Jesus cast out Legion (many evil spirits) from a possessed man in Gerasa.
The Bible records:

"People went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found
the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and
in his right mind (sound mind); and they were afraid." (Luke 8:35)

From learning the term sound mind, we can know that the Holy Spirit is capable
of bringing order to a person's thoughts and emotions. This is certainly in
line with the last fruit of the Spirit, which is self-control.

"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things
there is no law." (Galatians 5:22-23)

Therefore, for those who are struggling with confused hearts, minds, and
feelings, aside from possibly needing medical treatment, they most importantly
need the touch, fulfillment, companionship, and leadership of the Holy Spirit.
It is the Holy Spirit who provides the fruit of self-control, joy, and peace.  
Let us sing and reflect on the following song of the Holy Spirit Fill Us.

Holy Spirit Fill Us

Holy Spirit fill us  
I long for You always in my life  
Holy Spirit change my heart  
Awaken me, touch me, I long for Your presence

Chorus:  
I worship You, holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
And I exalt You, glorious, glorious to You, Lord
