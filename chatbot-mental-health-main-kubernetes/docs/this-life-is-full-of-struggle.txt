##  This Life is Full of Struggle

This life is full of struggles, This life is full of battles, Which require
resilience, And demand strength.

Oh, how our life is a war, A war against darkness, A war against ourselves, A
war against the devil. A war against the world, A war that won't cease Until
the time to come.

Grateful to God, the Warlord, Who provides the gear, The Word of God as our
weapon, And faith as our shield of protection.

Grateful also to God, our Helper, Who does not leave us to fight alone, And
gives us fellow believers, The holy and blameless Church of God.

Grateful to God, the Source of strength, He who fights for us, Who battles for
His people, And, who leads us into His victory.

One thing I realize, That I was created by God, To do good works, Which He has
prepared in advance. So, I understand, That I must struggle, To do His will,
For the glory of His name.

O my God, the Source of all blessings, Grant me, the weak, strength, Mercy,
and Your grace, So that I may fight for You, Lord, And carry out Your mission
in this world.

I hope in You, I ask of You, I lean on You.

Amen.

Jeffrey Lim 《 林秉恩 》
