##  Author's Preface

Praise and gratitude to the good LORD, God the Creator, Sustainer, and
Redeemer in the Lord Jesus Christ, who has permitted this simple book that has
long been wrestled with to be published. I hope this book can serve as a
theological reflection in the context of confronting the dark night of the
soul/depression.  
I am thankful for the support from my family, the servants of God, and fellow
believers. This book is a community project because I could not have written
it without the support and interaction from my dear friends. This theological
reflection is dedicated to those who are struggling with the dark night of the
soul, depression, and other mental disorders. The book presupposes the
existence of God and a Christian worldview in every struggle with the dark
night of the soul. Within it, readers can see that my struggles as a believer
are within God's story (His-story).  
Although it is academically accountable, this book is not intended to be an
academic textbook. Therefore, a Bibliography is still included at the end of
the book, but it is not cited on every chapter/page. The book itself is more a
discourse of theological reflection with various expressive responses, such
as: poetry, prayers, reflective meditations, songs, and so on.  
Happy reading. May what is contained in this book truly be a blessing to
others and bring glory to the name of the Lord.
