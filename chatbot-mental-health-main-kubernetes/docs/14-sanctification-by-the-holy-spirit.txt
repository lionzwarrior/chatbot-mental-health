##  14\. Sanctification by the Holy Spirit

"But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the
Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying
work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth." (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

The work and process of sanctification are acts of God that also require human
responsibility. Humans have intellect, emotions, will, and behavior. After the
fall into sin, all aspects of human life became tainted with sin. However,
there is hope for humanity through redemption in Jesus Christ. Those who
believe in the Lord Jesus are reborn, justified, given a new nature and status
as saints, and made children of God. Nevertheless, even with a new nature and
status as saints, believers can still sin. Therefore, day by day, the believer
must be sanctified by the Holy Spirit. This sanctification is a complete
purification in all aspects of human life, namely the heart, mind, emotions,
will, and behavior. A person suffering from depression, who is in Christ,
needs to experience progressive sanctification in their heart, mind, emotions,
will, and behavior. Thus, day by day, they are being shaped to be more like
Christ. Besides glorifying God, the purpose of a believer's life is to be
shaped to be more like Christ.

a. Sanctification of the heart.

After David realized his sin with Bathsheba, he prayed to the Lord:  
"Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
(Psalm 51:10).

This renewal of the heart can only be done by God Himself. And, God's promise
for the believer is:

"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from
you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My
Spirit in you and move you to follow My decrees and be careful to keep My
laws." (Ezekiel 36:26-27).

The Holy Spirit will continue to purify the believer's heart. The hope for
someone suffering from depression is that God can purify their heart so that
they will be holy and increasingly sanctified.  
"If we confess our sins, He (the Lord) is faithful and just and will forgive
us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).

The Word of God also says,  
"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the Lord. "Though your sins are
like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson,
they shall be like wool." (Isaiah 1:18)

b. Sanctification of the mind.

Human beings who have fallen into sin have darkened minds. However, the Holy
Spirit is the Spirit of Truth who illuminates and enlightens so that humans
can know the truth.  
"But when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all the
truth." (John 16:13).

The Holy Spirit opens our spiritual eyes so that we can understand the truth.
In this context, the psalmist prays:  
"Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law." (Psalm 119:18).

The hope for a person suffering from depression who believes in the Lord is
that the Spirit of God will lead them to the true reality. Their hope is that
the Spirit of God will guide them to the truth of God.

Although God promises that the Holy Spirit will guide someone into all the
truth, a person can grieve the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30). When the work of
the Holy Spirit is suppressed and ignored, the Holy Spirit grieves. The Holy
Spirit works gently and does not forcefully impose His will on believers. And
He can be saddened by the disobedience of believers. When a believer is not
obedient to the Holy Spirit, they are at a loss themselves.

Therefore, the believer—in this case, the one suffering from depression—needs
to be obedient and humbly pray to the Lord to be willing to teach His truth,
as the psalmist did:

"Make known to me Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your
truth and teach me" (Psalm 25:4-5).

The Bible says: "The Lord is good and upright; therefore, He instructs sinners
in His ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way"
(Psalm 25:8-9).

Guiding and leading is the work of the Holy Spirit.  
Here are some attitudes of the psalmist while meditating on the word of God
that should also be adopted by those suffering from depression while praying:  
"Praise be to You, O Lord; teach me Your decrees." (Psalm 119:12)

"Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in Your law." (Psalm 119:18)

"I am a stranger on earth; do not hide Your commands from me." (Psalm 119:19)

"I have recounted my ways and You answered me – teach me Your decrees." (Psalm
119:26)

"Let me understand the teaching of Your precepts; then I will meditate on Your
wonderful deeds." (Psalm 119:27)

"Direct me in the path of Your commands, for there I find delight." (Psalm
119:35)

"You are good, and what You do is good; teach me Your decrees." (Psalm 119:68)

"Your hands made me and formed me; give me understanding to learn Your
commands." (Psalm 119:73)

"Treat Your servant according to Your love and teach me Your decrees. I am
Your servant; give me discernment that I may understand Your statutes." (Psalm
119:124-125)

"Make Your face shine on Your servant and teach me Your decrees." (Psalm
119:135)

"Your statutes are forever right; give me understanding that I may live."
(Psalm 119:144)

The Holy Spirit leads believers to know God and His truth. However, there is a
condition that the believer must fulfill, which is to be humble and fear the
Lord. Regarding this, the Bible states:  
"Who, then, are those who fear the Lord? He will instruct them in the ways
they should choose." (Psalm 25:12).  
"The Lord confides in those who fear Him; He makes His covenant known to
them." (Psalm 25:14).

Therefore, let us come to the Lord with humility and in the fear of Him to
know His will. For,  
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy
One is understanding." (Proverbs 9:10)

c. Sanctification of emotions.

Human beings, fallen into sin, are filled with negative emotions, such as
suspicion, fear, worry, hatred, anger, lust, bitterness, and rage. However,
the Holy Spirit sanctifies believers so that their emotions can change
according to God's will.  
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control." (Galatians 5:22-23).

With this sanctification of emotions, those suffering from depression can have
hope to experience holy emotions according to God's will.  
How does God sanctify the hearts, minds, emotions, and behaviors of believers?  
First, by the word. Only the word of God can sanctify the heart, mind,
emotions, and behavior. That is why reading and meditating on His word is
something that believers must do to live a holy life  
"How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to
Your word."  (Psalm 119:9)  
"I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You."  
(Psalm 119:11).

God also sanctifies the hearts, minds, emotions, and behaviors of believers
through the blood of Jesus Christ.  
"In Him (Christ) we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace." (Ephesians 1:7)

"How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that
lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!" (Hebrews 9:13-14).

All work of sanctifying the heart, mind, emotions, will, and behavior is the
work of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of this sanctification is that believers
may love the Lord with all their heart, soul, mind, strength, and become more
like Christ.

May the Lord enable us to live increasingly shaped into the likeness of
Christ! This is the longing and purpose of our lives, to glorify God and
become more like His Son.

More Like the Master

    1\. More like the Master I would ever be,  
    More of His meekness, more humility;  
    More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,  
    More consecration for work He bids me do.

        Refrain:  
        Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;  
        Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own;  
        Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,  
        Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore.  
    
    2\. More like the Master is my daily prayer;  
    More strength to carry crosses I must bear;  
    More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in;  
    More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.  
      
    3\. More like the Master I would live and grow;  
    More of His love to others I would show;  
    More self-denial, like His in Galilee,  
    More like the Master I long to ever be.
