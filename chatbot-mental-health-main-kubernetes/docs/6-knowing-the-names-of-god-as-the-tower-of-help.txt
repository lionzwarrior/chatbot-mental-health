##  6\. Knowing the Names of God as The Tower of Help

"The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are
safe." (Proverbs 18:10)

The name of God is a strong tower as a help for those who believe in Him and
for those who struggle with depression. Individuals in a state of depression
need a foundation when they face trials. The name of God is God Himself. The
name of God is sacred, and through the Bible, we can see that God has given
grace by revealing Himself in difficult times with names that are relevant to
their situations.

Here is a list of some of the names of God that are truly relevant to the
struggles of mankind.

a. El-Shaddai (God Almighty)

This name appears and is revealed when Abraham had doubts about God's promise
regarding his offspring at his old age. When Abraham was unsure about this,
God revealed Himself as "I am El-Shaddai" (Genesis 17:1). El-Shaddai is
translated as "God Almighty" but its meaning is deeper than that, it is "The
Mighty Provider". This is the name of God who is Almighty, and has the power
to maintain, satisfy, and supply. El-Shaddai is the name that God revealed in
the patriarchal period, expressing what Abraham and the other patriarchs
needed to know, that their God provides and has the will and power to support
His provision with Almighty actions.

El-Shaddai, God Almighty. This word should have assured Abraham that in his
weakness and inability, there is One who is capable of fulfilling His
promises. Therefore, Abraham did not need to depend on himself or on ordinary
life circumstances. Indeed, he did not need to rely on the laws of nature.

When sufferers of depression face great struggles and feel incapable of facing
their difficulties, do not be afraid! Why? Because there is El-Shaddai. There
is a Lord who is Almighty. Therefore, there must be a way out because God is
able to fulfill His promises, even if the situation seems impossible. There is
the power of God. He is the Almighty, as Jesus said:  
"What is impossible with man is possible with God." (Luke 18:27)

b. Jehovah.

There is one name of God that if we understand its meaning, it can help
sufferers of depression and those with weak faith to obtain great comfort.
True that God is Mighty Provider or El-Shaddai. However, this concept does not
always address the central issue within the weak and fearful believer. This
person needs to be convinced that He is the God who keeps the covenant.

Jehovah is the name specifically associated with God in the covenant with His
people. Jehovah is God who relates to His people, and this relationship is a
committed relationship as between husband and wife.

This name is warm and personal in its use. When God created the heavens and
the earth the word Elohim (God) was used. However, when God created man, the
word Elohim Yahweh/Jehovah (Lord God) was used. The name Jehovah is used in a
warm and personal nuance.

The name is a verb form of to be from "I am that I am", "I am because I am",
"I will be that I will be". Because there are several possibilities, the
author refers to this name with the meaning under the phrase "Who was, who is,
and who is to be". Yahweh is the same Person yesterday, today, and forever.
Therefore, He is reliable and we can depend on Him.

This name is the Name above all, emphasizing that He holds His promises. Can
sufferers of depression trust God to do what He states in His word? Of course!
For Jehovah is the Lord God of the covenant and His loving-kindness is
forever.

"Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever."
(Psalm 136:1)

The name Jehovah has several more detailed names. Let's look at some of the
meanings of the name Jehovah in relation to the struggle with depression:

i. Jehovah Jireh = Jehovah will provide -- God will provide (Genesis 22:1-19).  
This name appeared when the Lord God provided a ram for Abraham in place of
Isaac who was to be sacrificed. God is the God who provides. Sufferers of
depression may face fear to move forward into an area full of questions, too
difficult, and threatening. The God who provided the ram for Abraham, who
provided the Lamb at Calvary for the redemption of sin, will certainly provide
for the needs of sufferers of depression, both spiritually and physically.  
There is an English song about Jehovah Jireh titled "Jehovah Jireh, My
provider." Here is the song.

Jehovah Jireh, My provider  
His grace is sufficient for me… 2x

My God shall supply all my need  
according to His riches in glory  
He will send His angels charge over me.  
Jehovah Jireh cares for me

(Source:Integrity's Hosanna! Music. Lyrics and song: Jehovah Jireh, My
Provider, Don Moen)

With the presence of Jehovah Jireh, sufferers of depression need not worry
about their physical and spiritual needs if they live by seeking the Lord and
His will. Do not worry about physical needs, food, clothing, and shelter.
Jehovah Jireh knows all of it. The Lord Jesus also affirmed this in His sermon
on the mount by saying, "Do not worry!"  
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things
shall be added to you." (Matthew 6:33).

ii. Jehovah Nissi = Jehovah our Banner -- The Lord is my standard (Exodus 17).  
Victory is something that a person suffering from depression needs. Victory
over enemies, temptations, and various trials. How can we all win the battle?
There is only one way, and it means advancing to face the battle under the
banner of God. This means we need to boldly move forward to face the enemy
whenever, wherever, when God commands to use the weapons and strategies He
provides. God advances when His banner is waved. His banner is waved when His
word is obeyed.

Those suffering from depression must also realize that God is a Warrior of war
(Exodus 15:3). The Lord fights for His people, and He also leads the battle
against the dark night of the soul/depression.

There are names of God that can be a strength for sufferers of depression,
including:  
a. El-Roy = God that seeth -- God who sees (Genesis 16:13).  
This name is taken in the story when Hagar wandered alone after being expelled
from Abraham's house. This is a strengthening story because this name gives
hope to the modern Hagar who wanders alone. When we are in dangerous places,
risky, and full of uncertainties at every corner, we are not alone. God sees
everything. God is the Omniscient Lord. God also sees, pays attention to, and
knows the struggle of the dark night of the soul/depression we are
experiencing.

b. The Rock -- The rock (Deuteronomy 32:1-43).The rock is a solid and enduring
stone and protects like the mountains in Jerusalem. God is the rock. Time and
chaos cannot change Him. His tower stands above all. Even though He often
seems silent and calm, He is always strong and always a never-failing refuge.
This is what sufferers of depression need. The rock of refuge. If the sufferer
of depression already has Jesus Christ as his personal Savior, then he is
leaning on the living Rock.

c. Shepherd (Psalm 23).  
Psalm 23, which contains a narrative about the Lord as a shepherd, is
certainly very familiar to believers. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want." (Psalm 23:1). Those suffering from depression have the assurance that
the Lord will shepherd their lives. The Lord provides food, drink, refreshment
of the soul, companionship, and abundant blessings forever. The Lord Jesus
also said that He is the good shepherd, who gives his life for his sheep (John
10:11). The Lord Jesus loves us so much, and that is a very great comfort.

d. My Light and My Salvation (Psalm 27).  
"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?" (Psalm 27:1). If
the Lord is with us, who can be against us? If the Lord is with us,
enlightening us, and saving us, then we need not fear. The Book of Proverbs
explains that "The name of the LORD is a strong tower, the righteous run to it
and are safe." (Proverbs 18:10). The name of Jesus in Hebrew is Yeshua, which
means the Lord saves. When the angel appeared to Joseph through a dream, he
said, "She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
because he will save his people from their sins." (Matthew 1:20).

The name of Jesus is a name of authority and power. There is power in His
name. The name of Jesus is a saving name. About this, the Bible says:  
"Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven
given to mankind by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)  
"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and
under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
the glory of God the Father." (Philippians 2:10-11)

The name of Jesus is a beautiful and glorious name. In this regard, there is
one spiritual practice -- the Jesus Prayer -- that can help those suffering
from depression when facing the dark night of the soul. This prayer
continuously calls on the name of the Lord Jesus like this: "Lord Jesus
Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner!" When believers continuously
call on the name of the Lord Jesus in prayer, they are indeed relating and in
fellowship with the Lord Jesus. And, in fellowship with the Lord Jesus, there
is salvation and restoration. When believers call the name of Jesus, it
becomes a weapon against all trials and disturbances from the evil one. The
Lord is present with us when His name is called. No one can claim that Jesus
is Lord except by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:3).

Let us continue to praise this beautiful name. The name above all names, the
name of the Lord Jesus!
