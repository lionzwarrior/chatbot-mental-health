##  2\. The Ultimate Purpose: The Glory of God

"For from Him and through Him and for Him are all things. To Him be the glory
forever!" (Romans 11:36).

The Westminster Catechism states that the ultimate purpose of man is to
glorify God and enjoy Him forever. The purpose of human life must be centered
on God. God is the ultimate reality that is different from creation.
Therefore, our mindset in discussing everything must be centered on God.
Because the glory of God becomes the most important and highest of all things.
All of creation and humanity must glorify Him. He is worthy of glory because
He is God.

"Thus says the LORD, the King and Redeemer of Israel, the LORD of hosts: 'I am
the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.'" (Isaiah 44:6).

Then, Isaiah 48:12 states:  
"I am the first and I am the last as well!"

Meanwhile, Revelation 1:8 says:  
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and
who is to come, the Almighty."

"The Lord is the first and the last" and "He is the Alpha and the Omega" means
that God is the beginning and the main cause of everything as well as the
final cause and purpose of everything. This understanding is the same as what
Romans 11:36 says:  
"For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things: To Him be the glory
forever!"

This is also in line with Colossians 1:16:  
"For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible
and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things
have been created through Him and for Him."

The purpose of human life is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. That is the
purpose for which you and I were created. Therefore, the main focus of the
theological reflection of this book is not on depression sufferers and their
recovery alone, but on the glory of God. God must be glorified in everything.
Everything must be God-centered. This is certainly contrary to secular
psychology, which places human well-being as the utmost. It is also different
from the humanistic concept that is centered on man. The Word of God declares
the Glory of God as the first and foremost thing.

Then, we think that if the glory of God is the most important, what does it
have to do with us? Is this something bad for us? Of course not. The glory of
God is not intended to make our situation difficult or depressed. Because, the
purpose of our life is in one package, that is to glorify God and enjoy Him.

The glory of God is also manifested in the happiness of believers. These are
not two conflicting things, but one thing with the same purpose. By rejoicing
in God, we also glorify God. The ultimate purpose of God in creation and the
maintenance of the universe is to express His glory through the happiness of
His creatures. When someone does not glorify God, he is not happy. Conversely,
when someone glorifies God, he is enjoying true happiness in life.

What does it mean to glorify God? Glorifying God is when humans do what God
desires with a joyful feeling and feel satisfied in Him. With satisfaction,
humans can be thankful and glorify God, and at that moment He is most
glorified.

Friends, if you are experiencing the dark night of the soul/depression, you
need to realize that God is glorified when we are satisfied in Him. And, the
glory of the Lord is also manifested in the happiness of His people. The Lord
wants His people to be happy because in this way He will be glorified. The
Lord wants us to be happy, in the sense of being spiritually blessed.

And, sometimes to glorify the Lord and enjoy that happiness, we need to go
through suffering. Because happiness and life trials are not opposing things.  
"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of
many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces
perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and
complete, not lacking anything." (James 1:1-4)

Perhaps, depression sufferers like you and me think, "Why does God allow me to
suffer?" Or, "Does God love me?" Of course! It is clear that God loves us all!
The entire Bible - from beginning to end - is filled with the story of God's
love for us. We are often the ones who do not understand what God is doing in
history and in our lives. We are the ones who do not understand God's plan. As
Ecclesiastes says:  
"I have seen the burden God has placed on the human race. He has made
everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart;
yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end." (Ecclesiastes
3:10-11)

When we do not yet understand the reasons behind the dark night of the
soul/depression or the mental disorder we are experiencing, believe that
everything will be beautiful in its time. The goodness and beauty will surely
come. And, do not be afraid, Friends. Because, the suffering in this life is
only like a dream that lasts for a moment. In the new heavens and earth, God's
people will be happy forever. The sufferings of the present time are very
brief compared to the eternity that is forever. Likewise, the suffering that
occurs now cannot be compared with the glory of the future. Because there is
indeed hope for the children of God in the future.

"For I am convinced that the sufferings of this present time are not worth
comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. For the earnest
expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of
God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of
Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with
birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also who have the
firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly
waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. For we were saved in
this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for
what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it
with perseverance. Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do
not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He who
searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes
intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all
things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the
called according to His purpose. For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to
be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
many brethren. Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He
called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also
glorified." (Romans 8:18-30)

The hope for the future becomes our strength in facing the struggles of
current life. And, it brings us back to the purpose of creation. The purpose
of man's creation is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. God is a God of
love and full of joy in Himself. He is a God who is happy and who wants His
people to be happy. Thus, there is hope for sufferers of depression and mental
disorders. Not always will that suffering dominate us. Because, the Lord is
greater than our suffering, and He loves us. In the book of Psalms, Moses
said:  
"Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as
we have seen trouble." (Psalm 90:15).

In the struggle for this inner suffering, remember several things:  
1\. The sovereign God is Love.  
2\. God is abundant in steadfast love and wants to share His love with us.  
3\. Man was created for the glory of His name.  
4\. Man was created to enjoy Him.

And, when we are not yet able to understand the reason behind the darkness
that occurs, may the Lord continue to reveal to us His plan and understanding.
Why did God create me and allow me to experience depression? Even if we may
not know the answer right now, may the Lord help us to understand that
everything will be beautiful in its time.

My Prayer  
My Lord, my God  
Thank you for creating me  
I know You are the Most Compassionate  
I know my life is to glorify You  
I also know, I am blessed in the Lord Jesus  
Often I do not understand  
Why do You allow me to experience the darkness of night  
Even so, one thing I still hold on to,  
That You are a God full of love  
You have a beautiful plan that I do not yet understand  
And, I believe I will glorify Your name  
Because that's the purpose of my life!  
Thank You, Lord  
In the name of Lord Jesus, I pray.  
Amen.  
(Selah)

In our misunderstanding and struggle, let us remain focused on loving and
glorifying the Triune God.
