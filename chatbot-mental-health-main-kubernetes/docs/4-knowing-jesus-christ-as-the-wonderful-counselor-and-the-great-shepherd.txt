##  4\. Knowing Jesus Christ as the Wonderful Counselor and the Great Shepherd

"I am the good shepherd, and I know My sheep and My sheep know Me." (John
10:14)

"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; He
has sent me to bring good news to the afflicted, to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to captives, and release to prisoners, to proclaim the
year of the LORD's favor and the day of our God's vengeance, to comfort all
who mourn," (Isaiah 61:1-2).

"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government will
be upon His shoulder, and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government
and peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom,
to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from this time
on and forever." (Isaiah 9:6-7).

The second person of the Trinity is Lord Jesus Christ.  
Who is Jesus Christ?  
The Word of God declares Him as the Savior of humanity. He is the Messiah. He
is the Son of God, and He is God Himself. In addition, He is also referred to
as the Counselor or Wonderful Counselor.

With various problems and pressures that humans face in life, "counselor" has
become a profession that is increasingly needed in this era. A counselor is
defined as someone who gives advice, guides, and directs their clients to find
a way out in dealing with life's problems. Counselors that we generally know
are those who work as psychologists, psychiatrists, and spiritual leaders.

Those suffering from depression need counselors who understand the Word of God
and its integration with other sciences. They need counselors who fear God and
rely on Him in their counseling practice.Psychologists and psychiatrists also
have roles to help the soul struggles of those who experience depression.
Psychologists, for example, can perform cognitive therapy to help depression
sufferers map their thoughts. Meanwhile, psychiatrists can provide a medical
approach that helps depression sufferers. Both are important because the
suffering of depression includes biological and physical aspects that need
attention.

Christian psychiatrists and Christian counselors have their respective roles
and places in the kingdom of God. However, who can truly help the deep
problems of depression sufferers? Who can help the deepest human soul? Who is
able to give encouragement to a heart that has faded?

The answer is Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Person who can help people who are
weary and burdened. The Old Testament has messianic prophecies about Jesus
Christ declaring Him as "Wonderful Counselor". Jesus Christ is the Wonderful
Counselor who can help every human being experiencing the darkness of the
soul.

Jesus Christ can help humanity because as God He knows and understands all
human thoughts and hearts. David describes it thus:  
“O LORD, You have searched me and known me; You know when I sit down and when
I rise up; You understand my thoughts from afar. You scrutinize me when I walk
and when I lie down, and are acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a
word on my tongue, but behold, O LORD, You know it altogether.” (Psalm
139:1-4).

In addition to knowing His creation and the problems they face, the Lord Jesus
is also capable of resolving the problems of His creation. Because, He is the
Almighty God.  
Furthermore, Jesus can also understand the struggles of the human soul because
He once became human. As a true human, Jesus also suffered and was tempted as
we are. The Bible says: "For because He Himself has suffered when tempted, He
is able to help those who are being tempted." (Hebrews 2:18).

He can certainly empathize with human suffering because He Himself has
struggled as a human. And, not only able to understand, He will also help us.
Because, in addition to being true man, He is also true God, the Almighty God.

There is a prophecy regarding Lord Jesus related to His role as Wonderful
Counselor in the Old Testament:  
"The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a disciple, that I should know how to
speak a word in season to him who is weary. He wakens morning by morning, He
wakens my ear to hear as a disciple." (Isaiah 50:4).

The words of the Lord Jesus strengthen those who are weary. His words also
provide hope and encouragement. He is so sensitive to the wounded that His
words have the power to heal. His Word truly provides hope, forgiveness, and
grace. This is what the Bible declares about Jesus' ministry as the Wonderful
Counselor:  
"A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff
out, but he will faithfully bring forth justice."  
(Isaiah 42:3).

Lord Jesus is full of compassion for the unfortunate and wounded. Sinful
humanity, with no hope, is like the bruised reed that He does not break. The
Lord still gives hope to them. Jesus' heart is full of gentleness. He truly
loves sinful humanity.  
"When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were
harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd." (Matthew 9:36).

Human life in sin is like scattered, abandoned, and wounded sheep. Lord Jesus
wants to restore them. His coming is not for the righteous, but for sinners.
He came not for the healthy, but for the sick. There is a beautiful and
touching story in the Bible about this.

One day, while Jesus was in the temple, the crowds came to Him, and He began
to teach them. At that time, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought
to Jesus Christ a woman caught in adultery. The Bible records that their
purpose in bringing the woman was to test Jesus. They said, "Teacher, this
woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law, Moses commanded us to
stone such women. Now what do you say?" This woman was being judged by the
crowd. She could do nothing but submit. She was full of shame, guilt, and
profound sadness. Her spirit was crushed. But what did Jesus do? He calmly
faced the people who intended to bring down the woman. He just stooped down
and wrote on the ground, as if He did not hear their question. When they kept
on questioning Him, He straightened up and said to them:

"Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
Then he stooped down again and wrote on the ground. At this, those who heard
began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was
left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked
her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She said, "No one,
Lord." And Jesus declared, "Then neither do I condemn you. Go now and leave
your life of sin." (John 8:2-11).

The Word of God declares that the Lord Jesus defended the sinful woman in
front of the crowd that judged her. Lord Jesus forgave and did not condemn
this sinful woman. God's heart is so gentle and filled with compassion towards
the repentant, broken sinner's soul. This woman's life could be restored and
changed because she received forgiveness from Lord Jesus. Then, who can judge
the one whom He has forgiven? God no longer judges the sinner because judgment
for sin has been laid on Jesus Christ at the cross.

The coming of Lord Jesus into this world is to bring good news, to free
sinners, and to care for the brokenhearted. He is the Wonderful Counselor who
heals the human soul. By His wounds, we are healed. The message He brought
when He came into this world is "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come
near!" (Matthew 4:17). The Lord wants to reign over all our lives. He wants to
be enthroned in your life and mine. And, the way into the Kingdom of God can
only be through repentance.  
Lord Jesus longs to help souls troubled by sin. Indeed, He can save them
because He is the Great Shepherd who loves His people.

In Psalm 23, the Bible teaches that Jehovah God is a good shepherd.  
"The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green
pastures, He leads me beside quiet waters; He refreshes my soul. He guides me
along the right paths for His name’s sake. Even though I walk through the
darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your
staff, they comfort me." (Psalm 23:1-6).

LORD (Jehovah) is the name of God used in the context of the Covenant with His
people. God promises to care for His people and reveals Himself to be full of
love, compassion, patience, loyalty, and forgiveness (Exodus 34:6-7). The
covenant God is a God who relates closely to His people.

The relationship between a shepherd and sheep is a beautiful metaphor for the
relationship between the covenant God and His people. We are familiar with the
sheep in Hebrew tradition (Genesis 49:24) and in the ancient Near Eastern
tradition. We know David, who before becoming the king of Israel was a
shepherd (1 Samuel 16:11). The Psalm 23 hymn that David wrote is certainly an
expression of his experience as a shepherd who knows his duties and
responsibilities. The literal job of a shepherd is to find grass and calm
water for his sheep and to protect the flock from wild animals, robbers, or
bad weather. For this, they are usually armed with a staff. Some shepherds
also skillfully use a sling. In addition, shepherds also seek and bring back
lost sheep, and act as guides, caretakers, and protectors. The ideal shepherd
in the Old Testament is one who is strong, self-sacrificing, and selfless. On
the other hand, the characteristics of sheep are animals that easily get lost,
cannot defend themselves, are weak, have difficulty finding their way home,
but can distinguish their shepherd's voice. These characteristics depict our
condition as humans. That's why the Bible often describes God as a Shepherd
who shows direction and gathers His sheep.

The LORD (Jehovah) is a God who, besides being communally related, also
relates individually to His people. The relationship between God and His
people is very close. He relates to me. The Lord is my Provider, Caretaker,
Protector, and Guide. He cares, watches over, and guards me. And, as
believers, we can all experience and feel the same thing.

In light of the New Testament, it turns out that the Shepherd referred to in
Psalm 23 is the person of Lord Jesus Himself. Jesus affirmed this by saying:  
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep;
the hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the
wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away— and the wolf snatches them and
scatters them. He runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for
the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— just
as the Father knows me and I know the Father— and I lay down my life for the
sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen; I must bring them
also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one
shepherd." (John 10:11-16).

Jesus is the Wonderful Counselor who is full of compassion for unfortunate
humans. He wants to help them. Therefore, Jesus invites sinful people to come
to Him so that they may repent and be forgiven. "Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn
from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your
souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." (Matthew 11:28--30).

With the assurance He has given, those suffering from depression who are
struggling can come to Jesus Christ, the Wonderful Counselor and Great
Shepherd, to receive relief from Him.
